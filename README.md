# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Description

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with X or O. The goal is to be the first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) wins.
4. If all 9 squares are full and no player has 3 marks in a row, the game is a draw.
